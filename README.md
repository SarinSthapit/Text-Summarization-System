# Text Summarization System
## Neural Network and Deep Learning (COMP 488)
## Mini Project

In this modern era of collection and utilization of data and information, it is important to extract concise yet comprehensive summaries from voluminous texts in order to understand it within a limited time. The Text Summarization System has been developed to generate abstractive summaries by understanding the entire document provided by the user, using a sophisticated and advanced approach, by utilizing the neural networks and the Transformer model, in order to employ the strategies and methods of deep learning to implement this summarizing system, that is able to provide the holistic understanding and core ideas of a document, which captures the essence of the document and be meaningful to the users. 


This project has been intended to address the growing needs of effective and time-saving systems for proper and cohesive understanding of pieces of information. The system focuses on crafting summaries that encapsulates the crux of the original text, using the principles of deep learning and fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
